In Next.js 15, the use of `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` with a `redirect` can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.  If the redirect logic isn't precisely controlled, it might result in an infinite redirect loop or a redirect to an unintended location. This often happens when the redirect condition isn't correctly evaluated based on the data fetched in these functions. For example, improperly checking for null or undefined values, or relying on asynchronous operations that haven't completed before making the redirect decision can cause this.
